## Hi  🧑🏻‍💻👋🏻

I am Shuzheng Si (司书正 in Chinese ✍🏻), a second-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. I am lucky to be advised by Prof. [Maosong Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and affiliated with [TsinghuaNLP Lab](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/). 


Now, my research interests lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically focusing on Data-centric Methods and Data Science for NLP, including Data Selection, Data Synthesis, and Learning from Noisy Data, etc. My long-term research goal is to elucidate the influence of data on LLMs and subsequently utilize these insights to effectively guide the organization, selection, and synthesis of high-quality data, thereby enhancing the foundational capabilities of LLMs (e.g., instruction following, factuality, and faithfulness).
