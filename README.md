## Hi  🧑🏻‍💻👋🏻

I am Shuzheng Si (司书正 in Chinese ✍🏻), currently a first-year CS Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University. I am lucky to be advised by Prof. [Maosong Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and affiliated with TsinghuaNLP Lab. Previously, I completed my master’s degree at Peking University and I was very fortunate to be under the supervision of Prof. [Baobao Chang](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=LaKNyhQAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Institute of Computational Linguistics. I spent my sweet undergraduate years at the School of Software (rank: 1/307) at Yunnan University (a very beautiful university) 🏫.


Now, my research interests lie in Large Language Models 🤖, specifically focusing on their Factuality and Alignment. My long-term research goal is to develop a trustworthy and helpful Language Processing Engine that speeds up the entire process of gathering, understanding, and processing textual information for billions of brain workers 🌏.
