## Hi  🧑🏻‍💻👋🏻

I am Shuzheng Si (司书正 in Chinese ✍🏻), a second-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. I am lucky to be advised by Prof. [Maosong Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and affiliated with [TsinghuaNLP Lab](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/). 


Now, my research interests lie in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, I have been interested in investigating LLMs' hallucinations from a data perspective and exploring data-driven hallucination mitigation methods for information-seeking tools. Find my up-to-date publication list in 🔗 [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=zO2XyZUAAAAJ). 

Feel free to drop an email if you are interested in connecting 🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏻.
