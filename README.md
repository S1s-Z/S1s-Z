## Hi 🧑🏻‍💻👋🏻

I am Shuzheng Si, currently a first-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University. I am lucky to be advised by Prof. [Maosong Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Previously, I completed my master’s degree at Peking University and I was very fortunate to be under the supervision of Prof. [Baobao Chang](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=LaKNyhQAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Institute of Computational Linguistics.


Now, my research interests lie in Large Language Models, specifically focusing on their Factuality, (data-efficient) Alignment, and important text-centred applications (e.g., Summarization). My research goal is to develop a reliable and helpful Natural Language Processing Engine that accelerates the whole process of gathering and processing textual information for users.
