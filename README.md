## Hi 🧑🏻‍💻👋🏻

I am Shuzheng Si (司书正 in Chinese) ✍🏻, currently a first-year CS Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University. I am lucky to be advised by Prof. [Maosong Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and affiliated with TsinghuaNLP Lab. Previously, I completed my master’s degree at Peking University and I was very fortunate to be under the supervision of Prof. [Baobao Chang](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=LaKNyhQAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Institute of Computational Linguistics.


Now, my research interests lie in Large Language Models 🤖, specifically focusing on their Factuality, Alignment, and important text-centric applications (e.g., Summarization). I try to address these areas' challenges by proposing new data-centric approaches, since the data we use are so powerful and important, but we still know very little about the data. My long-term research goal is to develop a trustworthy and helpful Language Processing Engine that speeds up the entire process of gathering, understanding, and processing textual information for billions of brain workers 🌏.
