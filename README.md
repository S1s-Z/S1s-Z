## Hi  🧑🏻‍💻👋🏻

I am Shuzheng Si (司书正 in Chinese ✍🏻), currently a first-year CS Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University. I am lucky to be advised by Prof. [Maosong Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works) and affiliated with TsinghuaNLP Lab. Previously, I completed my master’s degree at Peking University and I was very fortunate to be under the supervision of Prof. [Baobao Chang](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=LaKNyhQAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Institute of Computational Linguistics. I spent my sweet undergraduate days at the School of Software (rank: 1/307), Yunnan University, which is a very beautiful university 🍂.


Now, my research interests lie in Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models, specifically focusing on Data-centric Methods, including Data Selection, Data Synthesis, and Learning from Noisy Data, etc. My long-term research goal is to open the black box of data influence in LLMs and to improve the performance of LLMs using (organized, selected, or synthesized) high-quality data.
