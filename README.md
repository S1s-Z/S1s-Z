## Hi there 👋

I am Shuzheng Si, currently a first-year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University. I am lucky to be advised by Prof. [Maosong Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=zIgT0HMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Previously, I completed my master’s degree at Peking University under the guidance of Prof. [Baobao Chang](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=LaKNyhQAAAAJ&hl=en).


Now, my research interests lie in Large Language Models, specifically focusing on their Factuality and Alignment. Feel free to drop an email if you are interested in connecting.
